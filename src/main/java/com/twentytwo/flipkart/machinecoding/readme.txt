FlipFit Service:

This is a fairly vast service and hence I had to take a few assumptions. While I tried my level best to consider the best possible assumptions that I could make at that point,
there might be some instances, where we can take better assumptions, and I am more than happy to discuss them.

Following are a few assumptions that I can recall, this list might not be exhaustive and in case it misses some points, I will list them later:

    1. A slot is a time period of 1 hour, say from 0600 to 0700 hours.
    2. There can be multiple parallel workouts running at the same slot.
    3. For each slot, each workout there is a separate seat capacity.
    4. For now, all the workouts for a slot has to be added while creating the slot. However, this can be easily modified to add newer workouts to each slot.
